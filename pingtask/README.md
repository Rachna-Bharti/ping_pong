Here’s a sample `README.md` for your multiplayer ping-pong game project that you can use for your GitHub repository:

# Multiplayer Ping-Pong Game

This is a multiplayer ping-pong game built using a combination of **JavaScript** for the frontend and **Python (FastAPI)** for the backend with WebSocket integration. The game features real-time multiplayer, a pause and restart button, and live score updates.

## Features
- **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Play with another player in real-time.
- **Pause and Resume**: Pause the game anytime and resume by pressing the pause button or specific keys.
- **Restart Button**: Reset the game to start fresh and reset the scores.
- **Real-time Updates**: Ball and paddle positions are updated in real-time using WebSocket communication.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **HTML5** for structure.
- **CSS3** for styling and basic layout.
- **JavaScript** for game logic, WebSocket communication, and DOM manipulation.

### Backend:
- **Python (FastAPI)** for the backend server, which serves the game over WebSockets.
- **WebSocket** protocol for real-time communication between frontend and backend.

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiplayer-pingpong.git
cd multiplayer-pingpong
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Python packages using `pip`.

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Backend
Once the dependencies are installed, start the FastAPI server with Uvicorn.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the backend server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 4. Set Up Frontend

#### Install Node.js Dependencies (Optional, if using npm for frontend)
Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required npm packages.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 5. Run the Frontend
Open the `index.html` file in your browser to play the game.

You can also run the frontend using a local server if needed, for example using `Live Server` in VS Code or a similar tool.

### 6. Play the Game
- **Controls**: 
  - `W`/`S` (Player 1) to move up/down.
  - `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` (Player 2) to move up/down.
  - `Spacebar` to pause/resume the game.
  - `R` to restart the game and reset the score.
  
- **Game Updates**: Scores will be shown at the top of the screen. The game runs in real-time using WebSocket communication.
